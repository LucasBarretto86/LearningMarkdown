## What is Markdown?

Markdown[^1] is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

You can try it out, right now, using the online [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus).

## Disclaimer

This a brief example I made to explain some syntax and some concepts from markdown and how someone could organize and navigate in their notes inside a project. ðŸ’—

## Titles and subtitles

A single `#` set a title and a sequence of `#` up to 6 set subtitles.

To set title and subtitles prepend `#` on the begin of a line you want to turn into a title or subtitle.

### Titles

```txt
# This is a Title
```

**Output:**

![Title](imgs/titles.jpg)

### Subtitles

```txt
## This is a Subtitle
### This is a Subtitle
#### This is a Subtitle
##### This is a Subtitle
###### This is a Subtitle
```

**Output:**

![Title](imgs/subtitles.jpg)

## Text

### Regular paragraph

It's just plain text written in your notes, like this one.

### Blockquote

Highlight a sentence by prepending `>` on beginning of a line you want to turn into a highlight block of content.

You can nest many blockquote you want by prepending more `>` together, each `>` adds a new blockquote level.

```txt
> This is a highlighted text in your notes
>> Many blockquote nested
```

**Output:**

> This is a highlighted text in your annotation
>> Many blockquote nested

### Emphasizing

To emphasize some bit of a paragraph add around the text to be emphasized single `*`.

```txt
Some of these words *are emphasized*.
```

**Output:**

Some of these words *are emphasized*.

### Bold

To turn a bit of a paragraph into bold add around the text to be bolded double `*` or double `_`

```txt
Words can't describe how **strong** LOVE can be.

Words can't describe how __strong__ LOVE can be.
```

**Output:**

Words can't describe how **strong** LOVE can be.

Words can't describe how **strong** LOVE can be.

### Subscript

```txt
H~2~O
```

**Output:**
H~2~O

### Superscript

```txt
X^2^
```

**Output:**
X^2^

## Code

### Code inline

To add snippets of code inside a paragraph, to make some kind of reference add around the code single \`

```txt
This paragraph contains a snippet of code `code_reference`
```

**Output:**

This paragraph contains a snippet of code `print("Hello Wold")`

### Code block

To add block of code to show in detail a code add triples \`.

~~~txt
  ```py(rb, js, cpp, md)
  names = ["Lucas", "Someone"]
  
  def greetings(name):
      print(f"Hello {name}")
  
  greetings(names[1])
  ```
~~~

**Output:**

```py
names = ["Lucas", "Someone"]

def greetings(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")

greetings(names[1])
```

## Links

### External links

To add external links use the syntax `[Link label](website_address)`

```txt
[QQ home page](https://im.qq.com/index)
```

**Output:**

[QQ home page](https://im.qq.com/index)

### Anchors

Anchors are used when you want to make a reference to the same file but throwing the reader for specific header(Title or Subtitle) of your note: `[Header Title](#header-title)`

Notice that you have to convert header title or subtitle into a slug[^2]  and you have to prepend a single `#`

```txt
[What is Markdown?](#what-is-markdown)
```

**Output:**

[What is Markdown?](#what-is-markdown)

### Local File links

To add links to local files use the syntax `[Link label](path_from_the_file)`

Notice that you need to do use a relative path[^3]

```txt
[Example](example-10/local_file.md)
```

**Output:**

[Example](example-10/local_file.md)

## Images

Images works almost exactly like links, the only difference is the syntax because you need to prepend `!`, like `![Image Name](image_link_or_path)`

### Regular images

```txt
![ Example](imgs/image.png)
```

**Output:**

![ Example](imgs/image.png)

### Gif

```txt
![Example](imgs/run.gif)
```

**Output:**

![Example](imgs/run.gif)

## Lists

### Ordered List

To create a list prepend a numeric order prefix `1.`.

```txt
1. Put oil on the pan
2. Break the eggs
3. Put eggs on the pan scramble it
```

**Output:**

1. Put oil on the pan
2. Break the eggs
3. Put eggs on the pan scramble it

### Unordered List

To create a list prepend `-`.

```txt
- Summary
  - Chapter 1
    - First topic
```

**Output:**

- Summary
  - Chapter 1
    - First topic

## TODO List

To create a todo list it's used the prefix `- [ ]`, to check this todo it's used `- [X]`

```txt
- [ ] First do this
- [ ] After do that
- [ ] After that do that too
```

**Output:**

- [ ] First do this
- [ ] After do that
- [ ] After that do that too

### Table of Contents

Table of content is basically an unordered list where each element of list references a link with a heading anchor, listing the documents itself by it's heading structure.

![table of content](imgs/example-15.jpg)

**Output:**

![table of content](imgs/output-15.jpg)

## Foot notes

In markdown we can also add footnotes, for that we use `[^1]` or `[^bignote]`

### Numbered footnotes

```txt
This text is an example [^4], and this text is another example [^5]

[^4]: An example is just a demonstration
[^5]: This is just another demonstration
```

**Output**:

This text is an example [^4], and this text is another example [^5]

[^4]: An example is just a demonstration
[^5]: This is just another demonstration

### Big footnotes, multiple lines note

**Output**:

This text is an example [^bignote]

[^bignote]: This is an example from a big note.
  Basically it means a multiline note

## Table

### Head

First line of table is the head, where you set up the column labels.

Second line is where you define the alignment of the content:

> `:-----` = set context alignment to left;
>
> `-----:` = set context alignment to right;
>
> `:----:` = set context alignment to center;

### Body

After second line any new line will be new row in the table

```txt
| Name      |  Age  | Height  |
| :-------- | :---: | :-----: |
| Lucas     |  35   | 1.76m   |
| Someone   |  35   | 1.61m   |
```

**Output:**

| Name      |  Age  | Height  |
| :-------- | :---: | :-----: |
| Lucas     |  35   | 1.76m   |
| Someone   |  35   | 1.61m   |

## Appendix

### What is a Slug?

What is a Slug? A slug is the last part of the url containing a unique string which identifies the resource being served by the web service. In that sense, a slug is a unique identifier for the resource.

### Absolute and Relative paths

An absolute, or full, path begins with a drive letter followed by a colon, such as D:.

A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy. A single dot represents the current directory itself.

In the example directory structure below, assume you used Windows Explorer to navigate to `D:\Data\Shapefiles\Soils`. After navigating to this directory, a relative path will use `D:\Data\Shapefiles\Soils` as the current directory (until you navigate to a new directory, at which point the new directory becomes the current directory). The current directory is sometimes referred to as the root directory.
