## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

You can try it out, right now, using the online [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus).

*Reference:* [Markdown Official Project](#markdown-official-project)

## Disclaimer

This a brief example I made to explain some syntax and some concepts from markdown and how you could organize and navigate in your notes inside your own project. ðŸ’—

## Titles and subtitles

A single `#` set a title and a sequence of `#` up to 6 set subtitles.

To set title and subtitles prepend `#` on the begin of a line you want to turn into a title or subtitle.

### Titles

#### Example-1

```md
# This is a Title
```

Output

![Title #### Output](imgs/titles.jpg)

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

### Subtitles

#### Example-2

```md
## This is a Subtitle
### This is a Subtitle
#### This is a Subtitle
##### This is a Subtitle
###### This is a Subtitle
```

Output

![Title #### Output](imgs/subtitles.jpg)

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

## Text

### Regular paragraph

It's just plain text written in your notes, like this one.

### Blockquote

Highlight a sentence by prepending `>` on begining of a line you want to turn into a highlight block of content.

You can nest many blockquotes you want by prepending more `>` together, each `>` adds a new blockquote level.

#### Example-3

```md
> This is a highlighted text in your notes
>> Many blockquotes nested
```

Output

> This is a highlighted text in your annotation
>> Many blockquotes nested

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

### Emphasizing

To emphasize some bit of a paragraph add around the text to be emphasized single `*` or single `_`.

#### Example-4

```md
Some of these words *are emphasized*.

Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
```

Output

Some of these words *are emphasized*.

Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

### Bold

To turn a bit of a paragraph into bold add around the text to be bolded double `*` or double `_`

#### Example-5

```md
Words can't describe how **strong** LOVE can be.

Words can't describe how __strong__ LOVE can be.
```

Output

Words can't describe how **strong** LOVE can be.

Words can't describe how __strong__ LOVE can be.

## Code

### Code inline

To add snippets of code inside a paragraph, to make some kind of reference add around the code single \`

#### Example-6

```md
This paragraph contains a snippet of code `code_reference`
```

Output

This paragraph contains a snippet of code `print("Hello Wold")`

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

### Code block

To add block of code to show in detail a code add triples \`.

#### Example-7

```md
    ```py(rb, js, cpp, md)
    names = ["Lucas", "XiaoJiao"]

    def greetings(name):
        print(f"Hello {name}")

    greetings(names[1])
    ```
```

Output

```py
names = ["Lucas", "XiaoJiao"]

def greetings(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")

greetings(names[1])
```

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

## Links

### External links

To add external links use the syntax `[Link label](website_address)`

#### Example-8

```md
[QQ home page](https://im.qq.com/index)
```

Output

[QQ home page](https://im.qq.com/index)

[Go to Code Table](#code-table)

### Anchors

Anchors are used when you want to make a reference to the same file but throwing the reader for specific header(Title or Subtitle) of your note: `[Header Title](#header-title)`

Notice that you have to convert header title or subtitle into a slug [What is a Slug?](#what-is-a-slug) and you have to prepend a sigle `#`

#### Example-9

```md
[What is Markdown?](#what-is-markdown)
```

Output

[What is Markdown?](#what-is-markdown)

### Local File links

To add links to local files use the syntax `[Link label](path_from_the_file)`

Notice that you need to do use a relative path, read more about that in [Absolute and Relative paths](#absolute-and-relative-paths)

#### Example-10

```md
[Example](example-10/local_file.md)
```

Output

[Example](example-10/local_file.md)

## Images

Images works almost exactly like links, the only difference is the syntax because you need to prepend `!`, like `![Image Name](image_link_or_path)`

### Regular images

#### Example-11

```md
![ Example](imgs/image.png)
```

Output

![ Example](imgs/image.png)

### Gifs

#### Example-12

```md
![Example](imgs/run.gif)
```

Output

![Example](imgs/run.gif)

## Lists

### Ordered List

To create a list preprend a numeric order paramentes `1.`.

#### Example-13

```md
1. Put oil on the pan
2. Break the eggs
3. Put eggs on the pan scramble it
```

Output

1. Put oil on the pan
2. Break the eggs
3. Put eggs on the pan scramble it

### Unordered List

To create a list preprend `-`.

```md
- Summary
  - Chapter 1
    - First topic
```

Output

- Summary
  - Chapter 1
    - First topic

#### Example-14

```md
```

Output

### Table of Contents

Table of content is basically an unordened list where each element of list referecens a link with a heading anchor, listing the documento itself by it's heading strucure

#### Example-15

![table of content](imgs/example-15.jpg)

Output

![table of content](imgs/output-15.jpg)

## Table

### Head

First line of table is the head, where you set up the column labels.

Second line is where you define the alignment of the content:

> `:-----` = set context alignment to left;
>
> `-----:` = set context alignment to right;
>
> `:----:` = set context alignment to center;

### Body

After second line any new line will be new row in the table

#### Example-16

```md
| Name      |  Age  | Height  |
| :-------- | :---: | :-----: |
| Lucas     |  35   | 1.76m   |
| Xiao Jiao |  35   | 1.61m   |
```

Output

| Name      |  Age  | Height  |
| :-------- | :---: | :-----: |
| Lucas     |  35   | 1.76m   |
| Xiao Jiao |  35   | 1.61m   |

## Appendix

### What is a Slug?

What is a Slug? A slug is the last part of the url containing a unique string which identifies the resource being served by the web service. In that sense, a slug is a unique identifier for the resource.

*Reference:* [Slug](#slug)

### Absolute and Relative paths

An absolute, or full, path begins with a drive letter followed by a colon, such as D:.

A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy. A single dot represents the current directory itself.

In the #### Example directory structure below, assume you used Windows Explorer to navigate to D:\Data\Shapefiles\Soils. After navigating to this directory, a relative path will use D:\Data\Shapefiles\Soils as the current directory (until you navigate to a new directory, at which point the new directory becomes the current directory). The current directory is sometimes referred to as the root directory.
